# *My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo*
## Cameron Johnsen

I'm taking this class for two reasons: it's a general education requirement for my degree path and I think it will be highly beneficial in my future business endeavors.

After reading through the **Q & A with the internet** section, I found the following interesting:
- How physical the internet really is.  Seeing the diver come out of the water carrying a cable that will carry information/data thousands of miles was eye opening and makes me wonder where all the hidden end-to-end cable points are.
- How much data is being sent around the world in 1 second: 52,931 gigabytes!
- How unrecognizable the first website created by CERN was.  Compared to today's HTML and Java driven websites, the first website looks like something from Windows .cmd program
