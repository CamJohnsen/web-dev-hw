      <h3>Lyrics</h3>

        <pre>
          You heard my voice, I came out of the woods by choice
          Shelter also gave their shade
          But in the dark I have no name
          So leave that click in my head
          And I will remember the words that you said
          Left a clouded mind and a heavy heart
          But I am sure we could see a new start
          So when your hopes on fire
          But you know your desire
          Don't hold a glass over the flame
          Don't let your heart grow cold
          I will call you by name
          I will share your road
        </pre>

        <pre>
          But hold me fast, hold me fast
          'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
          And hold me fast, hold me fast
          'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
        </pre>

        <pre>
          I wrestled long with my youth
          We tried so hard to live in the truth
          But do not tell me all is fine
          When I lose my head, I lose my spine
        </pre>

        <pre>
          So leave that click in my head
          And I won't remember the words that you said
          You brought me out from the cold
          Now, how I long, how I long to grow old
        </pre>

        <pre>
          So when your hope's on fire
          But you know your desire
          Don't hold a glass over the flame
          Don't let your heart grow cold
          I will call you by name
          I will share your road
        </pre>

        <pre>
          But hold me fast, hold me fast
          'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
          And hold me fast, hold me fast
          'Cause I'm a hopeless wanderer
          I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
          And I will learn, I will learn to love the skies I'm under
          The skies I'm under
        </pre>
